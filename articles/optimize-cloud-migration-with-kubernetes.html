The cluster is managed by a control plane that orchestrates these nodes, ensuring high availability and efficient resource utilization. This architecture allows Kubernetes to handle workload distribution and provide fault tolerance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pods:</strong> Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes and can contain one or more containers that share the same network namespace and storage volumes. Pods abstract the underlying container, making it easier to manage applications as a whole and enabling Kubernetes to handle application lifecycles efficiently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Services:</strong> Kubernetes services provide stable IP addresses and DNS names to pods, allowing them to communicate with each other and external clients. Services also enable load balancing and ensure high availability by routing traffic to healthy pods. This setup is crucial for maintaining application reliability and performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deployments and ReplicaSets:</strong> Deployments manage the desired state of an application, allowing for easy updates and rollbacks. ReplicaSets maintain a specified number of replicas of a pod, ensuring that the application remains available even if some pods fail. These features provide robust version control and application resilience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ConfigMaps and Secrets:</strong> These components store configuration data and sensitive information, such as passwords and API keys, separately from the application code. This separation promotes security and flexibility by allowing dynamic updates without altering the application itself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
